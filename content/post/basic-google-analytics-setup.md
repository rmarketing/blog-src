In order to gain insights to your website's traffic and user behavior from reports or data analysis, you have to collect data of the website usage first.  Google Analytics does the core reporting and data collection. In this post we explain how to setup up a Google Analytics account with standard page tracking. If you already have a working Google Analytics account you can skip this post.

   1. Sign in to Google Analytics or create an account:
   <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/" target= "_blank">analytics.google.com</a>
   2. Click Admin (bottom left).
   3. In the ACCOUNT column, use the menu to select the account to which you want to add the property.
   If you have a lot of accounts, use the search box to help you find the right one.
   4. In the PROPERTY column, select Create new property from the menu.
   If you don't have Edit permission on the account, you won't see the Create new property option. Check that you've selected the correct account in the ACCOUNT column.
   5. Select Website or Mobile app.
   6. Enter the Website or App Name.
   If you plan on tracking more than one app in your account, use a very specific and descriptive name that includes the edition or version number. This will help you keep your app properties organized.
   7. (Web only) Enter the Web Site URL.
   8. Select an Industry Category.
   9. Select the Reporting Time Zone.
   This will be used as the day boundary for your reports, regardless of where the data originates.
   10. Click Get Tracking ID.

**Congrats!** Your account and property are set up after completing step 10.
Yet, you have to add the tracking code snippet to your website.
Instead of adding the code snippet directly we recommend to use another tool out
of Google's toolbox: the **Google Tag Manager (GTM)**. GTM is a nifty tool when
comes to staying in charge of a plethora of tracking tools and services.
Which is why we dedicated an [extra blog post to Google Tag Manager (GTM)](/blog/post/google-tag-manager).
