As discussed at the end of the previous post,
we recommend **Google Tag Manager (GTM)** as an umbrella for all your tracking
tokens and code snippets. Even if Google Analytics is the only service you use,
**GTM** remains a simple and expandable option.

The big advantage of **GTM** is that you only have to add a single code
snippet from Google Tag Manager to your website instead of including multiple
tracking snippets from services like Google Analytics, AdWords,
AdWords Remarketing, Facebook, etc. Through **GTM**'s web interface, you can
manage all these tracking snippets. That way you are flexible to make changes
or extend your tracking implementation in the future without touching the
code of your website.
