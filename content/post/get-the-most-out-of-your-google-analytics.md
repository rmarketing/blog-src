Many who use Google Analytics (GA) to track their websites' online traffic only
set up a basic tracking implementation. I.e., copy and paste Google's tracking code
snippet into one's website and start collecting data.

Doing so is sufficient to obtain basic metrics such as visitors or page views.
Yet simply placing a basic code snippet falls short of both: deeper and
regular analysis of your (e-commerce) online business.
And in turn it also falls short of actually learning from information by
steadily observing metrics and assess them over time.
Hence we start a series of blog posts to help you get the most out of
your Google Analytics implementation.

Our (future) posts will address:

   1. [the basic GA setup](../basic-google-analytics-setup/), in order to get y'all on the same starting page.
   2. how to use [Google Tag Manager (GTM)](../google-tag-manager) to leverage the overhead of setting up various tracking tools.
   3. how to keep track of performance indicators that drive your business, e.g.,
   online sales, revenues or subscriptions.
   4. how to to [enable e-commerce tracking](../ecommerce-tracking-with-google-analytics-and-tag-manager/)
   5. link your analytics account to Google Adwords, Google Search Console (formerly known as webmaster tools)
